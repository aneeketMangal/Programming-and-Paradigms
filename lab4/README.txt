This project is a perl implementation of the hangman game.

The instructions are simple:-
1. Run the game using command perl Hangman.pl in bash.
2. The game will ask you to input a letter until you have guessed the complete word.
3. You are allowed upto seven wron guesses.

Note:-
1. Incase someone enters a multi-character word, the first letter of it would be considered as the guess.
2. numbers and special characters can also be present.
